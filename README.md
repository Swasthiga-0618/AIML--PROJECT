# AI-Enhanced Customer Support Ticket Resolution and Proactive Issue Prevention System (Group 2)

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) to enhance customer support ticket resolution and proactively prevent issues. The system utilizes AI-driven techniques to analyze support tickets, predict potential problems, and suggest resolutions before they escalate. The repository contains code, datasets, and models to demonstrate AI's role in automating and improving customer support processes.

## 🚀 Features
- AI-based customer support ticket classification and resolution
- Predictive analytics for proactive issue prevention
- Sentiment analysis for better customer insights
- Automated response generation using NLP models
- Dataset preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive UI for customer support integration
- Visualization of results and analytics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (if applicable)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Flask / Streamlit (for UI)
